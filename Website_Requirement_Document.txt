    you are to follow these instruction step by step
    each step will contain a test which I will use to valida your implementation of the step

    2. add a clickable button to the webpage
        - the button should say "Generate Color Pallete"
        - print "button pressed" everytime the button is pressed
        test: I will press the button
    3. create 5 divs, each having a difference color (not white)
        test: I will look for the divs
    4. make the button randomize the divs's color
        test: I will press the button
    5. display each divs's color's hex code below each divs
        - the hex codes must update every time the button is pressed
        test: I will press the button
    6. display each divs's color's RGB values below each divs
        - the RGB values must update every time the button is pressed
